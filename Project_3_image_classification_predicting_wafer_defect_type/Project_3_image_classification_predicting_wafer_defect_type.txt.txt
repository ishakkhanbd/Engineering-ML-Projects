Project 2: Image Classification: predicting wafer defect type

Problem Statement: build an image classification model that predicts wafer defect type from popular MixedWM38 dataset.  


Dataset: 
Kaggle source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/co1d7era/mixedtype-wafer-defect-datasets
GitHub source: https://github.com/Junliangwangdhu/WaferMap
Dataset size: ~38k images. 

ML Algorithm used and compared: 
1. Baseline CNN, 
2. Baseline CNN with data augmentation, 
3. Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2).  

Results/Post Processing/Disclaimer: 
1. 10 epochs gets accuracy of ~100%. 
2. Confusion matrix is plotted with per-class classification report.
