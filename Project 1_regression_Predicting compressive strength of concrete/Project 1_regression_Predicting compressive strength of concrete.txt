Project 1: Regression: predicting compressive strength of concrete

Problem Statement: build a regression model that predicts compressive strength from inputs (cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, aggregates, age). 

Success criteria: RMSE < target and R² > 0.7 on test set.

Dataset: 
Main source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/165/concrete+compressive+strength 
Kaggle source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elikplim/concrete-compressive-strength-data-set 
Dataset size: 1030 rows, 9 columns. 

ML Algorithms used: 
1. Baseline linear regression, 
2. Random forest regression, 
3. K-fold cross validation. 

Results/Post Processing: 
1. Linear Regresion: RMSE, R2. Predicated vs actual plot. 
2. Random Forest Regression: Feature importance, residual distribution.
