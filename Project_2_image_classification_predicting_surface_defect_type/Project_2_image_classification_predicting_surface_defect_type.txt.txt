Project 2: Image Classification: predicting surface defect type

Problem Statement: build a classification model that predicts surface defect type from grayscale images of hot-rolled steel strip. 


Dataset: 
Kaggle source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhdikshit/neu-surface-defect-database
Dataset size: 3600 images of 6 different types. 

ML Algorithm used: 
1. Sequential CNN. 

Results/Post Processing/Disclaimer: 
1. Only 10 epochs are run. More realistic scenario is to run for more epochs. 
2. Confusion matrix is plotted with per-class classification report.
